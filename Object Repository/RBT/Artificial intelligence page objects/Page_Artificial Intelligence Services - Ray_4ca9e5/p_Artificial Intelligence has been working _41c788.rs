      <value>Artificial Intelligence has been working at the forefront of the latest technology contributing to automation and better process efficiency. Crunching raw data to produce valuable information for decision making has been the foray of AI, leading to process optimization and, finally, goal-bound results. Through Machine Learning, enterprises can explore the real power of data-driven processes fine-tuned to unique business demands.   

AI models use Python and R for crunching data, analysis, and representation. 

Python – Python is a high-level, multi-reason, and general programming language that emphasizes logical coding and is used as a major tool in AI.

R – R is a robust programming language particularly used for statistical analysis and graphical support.

Ray Business Technologies has been contributing to advanced research and innovation in Artificial Intelligence to design best-in-class AI solutions that achieve business requirements with a result-oriented approach. The brand boasts of a core team of R and Python developers with commendable proficiency in learning models for coding intelligent bots and assistants.
